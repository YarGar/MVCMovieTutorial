Tutorial found here: http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started

>This was the first MVC tutorial I've done. Though I had an Idea about what MVC was, this was the first time I actually put it into practice. The learning curve was challenging to get over but I feel much better about my understanding after finishing this tutorial

<h4>What I learnded<h4>
  - General MVC
  - Connection strings
  - Database migrations and using the Package Manager Console
